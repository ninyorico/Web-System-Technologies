        <h1>Parts Of A Website: A Cheat Sheet For Non-Techies</h1>
        <img src="parts_of_a_website-2.png">
    </center>

    <h1>Basic Anatomy of a Website</h1>
    <h1>Header</h1>
    <p>The header is the top section of a website, where you’ll usually find the logo and the site’s navigation menu. It’s that steady, reliable part of the page that stays visible no matter where visitors click on your site.</p>
    <p>Years ago, headers often featured big banners or graphics to promote a brand—similar to the cover photo on a Facebook page. But these days, the trend is to keep things simple, with just a logo, navigation, and possibly a call-to-action button to keep your website looking clean and modern.</p>

    <h1>Pre-Header</h1>
    <p>The pre-header is the thin strip that sits above the main header. It’s often used to display helpful information like your contact details, business hours, special offers, or even secondary navigation links. Think of it as a small but mighty space for quick-access details that your visitors might appreciate seeing right away.</p>
    <center><img src="pre header.jpg" alt=""></center>

    <h1>Favicon</h1>
    <p>A favicon is the small icon that appears in a browser tab next to your website title. It’s usually a simplified version of your logo or brand mark. Favicons help visitors quickly identify your website when they have multiple tabs open, and they add a polished, professional look to your site.</p>
    <h1>Navigation (AKA Navigation Bar or Main Menu</h1>
    <p>The navigation is the set of links at the top of a website that helps visitors find what they’re looking for. These links are usually part of the header or located just below it.</p>
    <center><img src="favicon.jpg" alt=""></center>

    <h1>Breadcrumbs</h1>
    <p>Breadcrumbs are a type of navigation that shows visitors their location within a website’s hierarchy. They usually appear near the top of the page and look something like this:</p>
    <p>Home > Blog > Latest Posts > Post Title</p>
    <h1>Homepage(or home page)</h1>
    <p>The homepage — also called the front page or main page — is the starting point of most websites. It’s often the first page visitors see and serves as a central hub to guide them through your site.</p>
    <center><img src="homepage_hero_area_example.jpg" alt=""></center>

    <h1>Sidebar</h1>
    <p>A sidebar is the narrow vertical column that appears alongside your main website content. It’s often used to display things like advertisements, links to other content, calls to action, or a search box. Think of it as a supporting area for secondary information that complements the primary content.</p>
    <p>In recent years, many websites have moved away from using sidebars altogether, opting instead for a single, full-width layout. For some websites, removing the sidebar makes sense; for others, it doesn’t. The decision really comes down to personal preference, the user experience you want to create, and which layout (sidebar vs. no sidebar) works better for your goals—like improving readability or increasing conversions.</p>

    <h1>Sub- Footer</h1>
    <p>The sub-footer is the section that appears at the bottom of a webpage—just above the main footer—and is consistent across your site. Think of it as a secondary navigation bar that provides additional points of access or contact details once visitors have scrolled through the primary content. While its content varies by site, a sub-footer typically includes elements such as:</p>
    <li>Quick Contact Information: Displaying addresses or phone numbers for immediate reference.</li>
    <li>Supplementary Navigation Links: Offering shortcuts to key pages like “About Us,” “Services,” or even “Our Locations.”</li>
    <li>Social Media Icons: Allowing visitors easy access to your social profiles. Allowing visitors easy access to your social profiles.</li>
    <li>Additional Resources: This might include links to site maps or ancillary informational pages.</li>
    <p>The sub-footer is designed to serve as an added layer of user convenience, enriching the overall navigation experience without being as formal as the main footer.</p>

    <h1>Footer (The True Footer)</h1>
    <p>The footer is the final, definitive section at the very bottom of a webpage. It typically contains essential legal, informational, and administrative details that are less frequently updated but are critical for compliance and user trust. Common footer contents include:</p>
    <li>Copyright and Legal Disclaimers: Noting trademark rights and the copyright year.</li>
    <li>Policy Links: Links to the privacy policy, terms of use, and any other legal information.</li>
    <li>Site Map: A detailed breakdown of the website’s structure for improved navigation and SEO.</li>
    <p>This section is static across the entire site and represents the definitive end point of your webpage content.</p>
