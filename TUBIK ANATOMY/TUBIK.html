        <h1>The Anatomy of a Web Page: 14 Basic Elements</h1>
        <p>Review the essential elements of a web page, learn what impact each element has and how it contributes to the general user experience. Packed with web design examples.</p>
        <h1>Header</h1>
        <p>Header is the upper (top) part of the webpage. Being the area people see before scrolling the page in their first seconds on the website, the header is an element of strategic importance. It is expected from the header to provide the core navigation around the website so that users could scan it in split seconds and jump to the main pages that can help them. Headers are also referred to as site menus and positioned as an element of primary navigation in the website layout.</p>
        <li>basic elements of brand identity, usually a logo</li>
        <li>call-to-action button</li>
        <li>links to basic categories of website content</li>
        <li>links to the social networks</li>
        <li>basic contact information (telephone number, e-mail address, etc.)</li>
        <li>switcher of the languages in case of the multilingual interface</li>
        <li>links to interaction with the product such as trial version, downloading from the AppStore, etc.</li>
        <p>It doesn‚Äôt mean that all the mentioned elements should be included in one web page header: in this case, the header section would be overloaded with information. The more objects attract the user‚Äôs attention, the harder it is to concentrate on the vital ones.</p>
 

        <h1>CTA Button</h1>
        <p>A call-to-action (CTA) button is an element of a user interface aimed at encouraging a user to take a certain action. This action presents a conversion for a particular page or screen (for example, buy, contact, subscribe, etc.). In other words, it turns a passive user into an active one. So, technically it can be any type of button that is supported with a call-to-action text. This type of button differs from all the other buttons on the page or screen due to its engaging nature: it has to catch attention and stimulate users to do the required action.</p>
        <p>Effective call-to-action buttons are easy to notice; designers intentionally create them so that website visitors could see them in split seconds and respond. That‚Äôs why they are usually bold buttons containing microcopy with a particular call to action (e.g., ‚ÄúLearn more‚Äù or ‚ÄúBuy it now‚Äù), which explains the main action for this page and encourages a user to do it. If CTA buttons are not clearly defined and don‚Äôt attract attention, visitors are likely to scan the content quickly and leave it untouched.</p>
    
        <h1>Hero Section</h1>
        <p>Hero section is the above-the-fold (pre-scroll area of the web page containing the element that presents the strong visual hook: a hero image, slider, catchy piece of typography, video, or anything else attracting visitors‚Äô attention and transfers a needed message to them. Make no mistake, the term doesn‚Äôt require that all images of this kind should include a human, animal, mascot, or any other kind of character. Don‚Äôt get tricked over with that ‚Äúhero‚Äù part. It can also be the product photo or the theme image featuring a landscape, a device, a building ‚Äì anything, even an abstract model or composition. The main idea is that the visual hook in the hero section instantly grabs attention and allows for setting the quick visual, emotional, and informative connection with the users, engaging them to scroll or push the buttons to learn more.</p>
    
        <h1>Footer</h1>
        <p>Footer is the lower (bottom) part of the web page which usually marks its end. Being another common zone of global website navigation, the footer provides the additional field for useful links and data users may be interested in finding.</p>
        <p>Footers can include:</p>
        <li>brand identity signs, usually the name and logo of the company or product</li>
        <li>links to user support sections, for example, FAQ page, About page, Privacy Policy, Terms and Conditions, Support Team, etc.</li>
        <li>credits to website creators</li>
        <li>contact forms and information</li>
        <li>links to company or product accounts in social networks</li>
        <li>testimonials and badges</li>
        <li>certification signs</li>
        <li>subscription field or button.</li>
        <p>As well as the header, the footer is not the element found in all websites users can come across the web. For instance, when infinite scrolling is applied, the traditional footer is not an effective navigation zone. However, in the case of infinite scrolling, the idea of a fixed footer can also be applicable and support navigation not losing this area. For most users, the footer is a common place to search for contact information, credits, and sitemaps, so playing on this pattern can be beneficial.</p>
